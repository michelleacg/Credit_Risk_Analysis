# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Purpose

Fast Lending a Peer to Peer Lending Services company wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk. Management believes this will provide. a quicker and more reliable loan experience. It also believes that machine learning will lead to a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which lead to lower default rates. 

### Results:

Built and evaluated several models or algorithms to predict credit risk. Using techniques such as resampling and boosting  


### 1. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
